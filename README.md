# Ecosystem Generator
This tool creates automatic visual reports for the startup ecosystems. Each script is created for different usecase and datasets.

## Pioneers Table Report
The purpose of this script is to take the spreadsheet downloaded from PioBay platform, extract the relevant data and turn it into visual report. It consists of the ecosystem map image with the logos of the companies displayed on it and afterwards a table that gives the name, domain and description of every company in the spreadsheet based on the specific industry. 

P.S. Due to the data handling rules the logos and names on the report are blurred.

## Austrian Startups Piechart Report
This project has similar purpose to the previous, but required a different visualization and many more industries to be included in the circle shape. 

This tool is currently under development.
